# EventCreate project

## Developer Exercise
Build a responsive single-page application (SPA) using React that allows a user to submit and
edit existing data in a table interface.
### The application should:
1. Allow the user to submit a form with the following fields: Name, Email, and Age
2. Allow users to add/remove a custom field dynamically to the form
3. Validate inputs (eg, Email format, Age as a positive number)
### After submitting the form, the user should be able to:
4. View the data of their submissions in a table
5. Edit previously submitted data
6. Visualize their data as a chart (e.g., Bar or Pie Chart) to visualize the data (use a library
like Chart.js or D3.js) that updates when new information is submitted.

## Notes
- The application should be optimized for fast loading and handle up to large data entries
without noticeable lag.
- Building a backend is not necessary but exercise should showcase how data is handled
and loaded client side on the application.
- Buidling for all test cases and scenarios is not necessary but code should showcase
your knowledge and experience with testing front end code.

## Deliverables
- Submit a GitHub repository link containing your code with a README on how to run the project.
- Feel free to add any additional information about your design decisions here.
